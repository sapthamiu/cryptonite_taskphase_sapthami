# Hello Hackers

## Intro to Commands
### Description
In this level, invoke the hello command to get the flag! Keep in mind: commands in Linux are case sensitive: hello is different from HELLO.
### Approach
The command was specified as `hello`, which directly gave the flag.  
### Commands
`hello`
### Flag
`pwn.college{wg5e1GjMStaRzP_PTYaAck5OfLA.ddjNyUDLyUzM2czW}`

## Intro to Arguments
### Description
In this challenge, to get the flag, you must run the hello command (NOT the echo command) with a single argument of hackers. Try it now!
### Approach
`echo` is a simple command that "echoes" all of its arguments back out onto the terminal.
### Commands
`hello hackers`
### Flag
`pwn.college{4XCQVFouKzzJ_AMTi9jQmHgfN-X.dhjNyUDLyUzM2czW}`
